# EU5 Mod Development - Auto-detect Game Source Folder Guide

As an experienced EU5 modder, you need to automatically locate and reference Europa Universalis V's game source folder when handling mod development tasks. This guide covers finding and using the game source folder.

## Importance of Game Source Folder

EU5's game source folder contains all original game files (events, localization, scripts, etc.). During mod development, you need it to:
- Reference original game mechanics
- Ensure mod compatibility with game version
- Reuse original resources (localization keys, script templates, etc.)

## Standard Game Installation Paths

EU5 is typically installed at (in priority order):
- `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Europa Universalis V\game`

## Error Log Location

When debugging mod issues or checking game errors, always check the error log:
- **Standard error log path**: `C:\Users\qiushi\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis V\logs\error.log`

### How to Use Error Logs

1. **When to check**:
   - After game crashes or errors
   - When mod files fail to load
   - When testing mod changes
   - When verifying syntax errors in scripts

2. **How to check**:
   - Read the error log file directly
   - Look for recent error entries (usually at the end of the file)
   - Parse error messages to identify problematic files and line numbers
   - Check for missing localization keys, syntax errors, or invalid references

3. **Error log format**:
   - Errors are typically timestamped
   - Include file paths and line numbers when available
   - May contain stack traces for script errors

**As an agent, you should**:
- Automatically check the error log when debugging mod issues
- Parse error messages to identify the specific problem
- Reference the error log path when helping users troubleshoot
- Suggest checking the error log if issues persist
