 # Late Ming Age (1644)
 age_1_traditions: "Late Ming"
 age_1_traditions_desc: "In 1644, the Great Ming Dynasty stands on the brink of collapse. Political corruption, financial difficulties, military crises, and social unrest intertwine. Peasant uprisings surge across the land, while foreign threats loom on the horizon. This is an age of declining central authority and rising regional powers, an era where the old order crumbles and a new order is born.\nFor the Ming Dynasty, this is a moment of life and death; for emerging forces, this is an opportunity to reshape the empire."
